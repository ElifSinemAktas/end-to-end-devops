## An Experimental Study for DevOps Practices and Tools

### Project Overview

1. Infrastructure: We'll begin by setting up the core infrastructure. This is the foundation upon which the rest of the project will be built.

2. Development: After the infrastructure is in place, we'll configure version control systems and development environments, ensuring consistent workflows and enabling smooth collaboration for developers.

3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): In this stage, we'll build automated pipelines that handle code testing, building, and deployment. These pipelines will reduce manual intervention and accelerate the release cycle.

4. Deployment: Once the infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines are ready, we'll focus on deploying applications.

5. Monitoring and Logging: We'll implement monitoring and logging solutions to track performance, gain insights, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

Depending on how the project progresses, we may also explore best practices in security.Â Throughout this journey, I'll be selecting tools based on their popularity, robustness, and ease of integration to simulate a real-world environment.

**For reference, I'm working on Windows 11 with 32 GB of RAM and a 10-core processor.**
